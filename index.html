        <p>A passionate artist who has made a career first as a graphic designer and then shifted to the 3D world. I have built well over 1000 3D products accompanied by a 3D environment from which their advertisements were crafted. Self-taught until
          earning my Bachelor of Science with a focus in Software Development. I possess the ambition to learn something new every day and never settle for only what I knew yesterday. Along the way in my studies, I found a new passion for UX/UI
          design!
          I would love to chat with you, please feel free to contact me.
